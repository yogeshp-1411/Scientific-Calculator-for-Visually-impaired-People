# Scientific-Calculator-for-Visually-impaired-People
Disability should never limit ones capacity. In an effort to help visually impaired people, I came up with an idea to develop a Calculator for visually impaired people. As a part of my third year Bachelors project, the prototype was highly appreciated by the examiners and Head of Departement..

History:
--------------------------------------------
I always had a mentality to break the stereotypes and do something unique. One day I came up with an idea of developing a Calculator for Visually impaired people.
After doing some research, I found out that such calculators already exist in market and basic calculations can easily be done on smartphones. 
Continuing, I realised that scientific calculators are not easily available and are not economical for use. With this, the concept of this prototype came in my mind.

About:
--------------------------------------------
This calculator takes Braille key strokes as input. Multiple Scientitfic Calulations are also performed including sine, cosine, factorial, logarithmic,
exponential, power functions. Output of the calculator is an audio file generated dynamically. The calculator is very portable and easy to use. 
This calculator prototype can be developed very cost efficiently. 
The cost can further be reduced by creating a DAC with electronic circuit. With having some time restrictions, I have used Arduino Due powered by Arm Cortex processor having inbuilt DAC.
SPI protocol is used for the Due to communicate with SD card module. .wav audio files of numbers are stored on the SD card.

final-test.ino provides the code for the prototype. 
Connection diagram can be found in the report attached.
